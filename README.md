# flood-experience

## RQ: What is the impact of flood experience on flood preparedness? 
## What we want to find out ideally: Is this effect different in hurricane regions? -

### Hypotheses: 
Main effects of interest: 
- Flood experience has a positive effect on preparedness
- Hurricanes have a less positive effect on preparednesss than flood experience

Socioeconomic variables:
- age and income have an ambiguous effect on preparedness
- education and homeownership have a positive impact on preparedness

Other hypthesized effects:
- insurance has a positive effect on preparedness????
- risk perception has a positive impact on preparedness. Especially on alerts. Less so on structural measures
- efficacy has a positive effect on preparedness
- awareness has a positive impact on prepardnesss 


Data: 
- EDA_v2: efficacy, perception, awareness, floodzone dropped
