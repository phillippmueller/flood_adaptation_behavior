# flood-experience


## working questions:
### What is the effect of experience on insurance? 
- compare Miami v Jacksonville
- could this be an interesting climate justice case?

### Which types of flood adaptation are impacted by adaptation fatigue? 
- compare Florida v New York
- is higher experience leading to less adaptation? Experience is akin but measures only dummy, not number of storms experienced. We shuold therefore see no impact of experience on adaptation for adaptation types impacted by adaptatin fatigue.
- Are we expecting no correlation for all adaptation types in Florida then?
-   home building codes are stricter in florida -> only look into non-structural adaptation
-   Florida has higher insurance rates 

### Why is the effect of experience on insurance so low? 
- people in florida are insured more but experience in the data is less (seperating equilibrium?)
- in Washington and New York effect of experience on insurance high, in Florida not
