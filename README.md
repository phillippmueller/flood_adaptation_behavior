**Abstract**

Rising sea levels are reshaping coastlines. Rising global temperatures are driving storm surges. While adapting to ever increasing flood damage becomes ever more urgent, US state budgets for disaster preparation are being cut. The burden of climate change-induced flood damage is shifting from governments to private households. To design effective adaptation policy, decision makers must understand the drivers behind household level flood adaptation behavior. We analyze the 2023 FEMA National Households Survey to explore two questions. What determines household-level flood-adaptation behavior and do the effects of these determinants vary in hurricane regions? The effects of twelve cognitive, geographic, and socioeconomic determinants were tested on ten structural and non-structural adaptation categories, using nonlinear probability models. Household adaptation behavior is strongly driven by cognitive variables. Risk perception emerges as the single strongest, consistently significant predictor across all adaptation measures. Geography plays a role in adaptation behavior. Households in hurricane regions report higher baseline risk perception and higher baseline preparedness. The effect of risk perception on adaptation appears to be mediated by hurricane regions. A priori flood experience and geographic flood risk appear to shape risk perception. More research is needed to understand the causal pathways through which geographic risk in larger hurricane areas and sub zip-code level flood zones are impacting adaptation decision making. Socioeconomic determinants were consistently found to have no effect on adaptation decisions, calling findings from the literature into question, especially regarding the feedback loop between risk exposure and social vulnerability. We propose participation in the National Flood Insurance Program as a pragmatic proxy for community preparedness. By identifying proxies for preparedness levels and determinants of adaptation behavior, we hope to inform flood adaptation policy in times of rising tides.
