# flood-experience

## game plan: 
#### assumption: 
At equal frequency, Florida has heavier storms than New York
#### hypothesis: 
Florida is suffering from disaster fatigue
#### expected findings: 
Effect of disaster experience on adaptatin is lower in Florida compared to New York
- only look int non-stuctural adaptation measures since florida has stricter building codes
- what about individual v interactive adaptation measures?
- do a sensitivity check with Wachington state
- potential hypothesis: we are expecting specific adaptation measures to be affacted by disaster fatigue more than others (reasoning from lit review)
#### cnoclusion:
Community disaster fatigue is posing a type of soft limit to adaptaion
#### to do: 
- make this an econmics narrative (hypothesize ratinal agents and find opposite?)
- do the preliminar regrssions
- double check the terminology
- double check the code (do some sensitivity with outliers and nans?)
- read srijiths paper on limits to adaptation
- read book chapter on community disaster fatigue

## working questions:
### What is the effect of experience on insurance? 
- compare Miami v Jacksonville
- could this be an interesting climate justice case?

### Why is the effect of experience on insurance so low? 
- people in florida are insured more but experience in the data is less (seperating equilibrium?)
- in Washington and New York effect of experience on insurance high, in Florida not  

### Which types of flood adaptation are impacted by adaptation fatigue? 
- compare Florida v New York
- is higher experience leading to less adaptation? Experience is akin but measures only dummy, not number of storms experienced. We shuold therefore see no impact of experience on adaptation for adaptation types impacted by adaptatin fatigue.
- Are we expecting no correlation for all adaptation types in Florida then?
-   home building codes are stricter in florida -> only look into non-structural adaptation
-   Florida has higher insurance rates
